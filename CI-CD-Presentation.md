# CI/CD Fundamentals: Core Concepts and Terminology

## Slide 1: What is CI/CD?
**Title:** CI/CD: The Foundation of Modern DevOps

**Content:**
- CI = Continuous Integration
- CD = Continuous Delivery/Deployment
- Automation of software delivery pipeline

**Presenter Notes:**
- Define CI/CD at a high level: automation of building, testing, and deploying software

---

## Slide 2: Why CI/CD Matters
**Title:** The Business Case for CI/CD

**Content:**

- Higher Quality Software
- Reduced Deployment Risk
- Developer Productivity

**Presenter Notes:**
- Explain how CI/CD reduces the time between writing code and delivering value to users
- Discuss how automated testing improves software quality and reduces bugs
- Highlight that smaller, more frequent deployments reduce risk compared to large, infrequent releases
- Mention that CI/CD frees developers from manual tasks, allowing them to focus on creating value

---

## Slide 3: Continuous Integration
**Title:** Continuous Integration: Building with Confidence

**Content:**
- Frequent code integration
- Automated build process

- Describe how environments should be as similar as possible to reduce "works on my machine" issues
- Highlight the importance of environment-specific configuration
- Discuss the trade-offs between environment fidelity and cost
- Mention that environment provisioning should be automated

---

## Slide 10: Configuration Management
**Title:** Configuration Management
